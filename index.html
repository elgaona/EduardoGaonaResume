    Profile
</div>

<p> In my experience I have used Linux to run evaluations/tests for the Google Search Engine. In less than 1 year I have become the point of contact for Evaluations/Tests. I have used wordpress to create a website for an organization at the University of California, Santa Cruz. I have used JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create a data visualization of the immigrant population in the United States. Also, I have used Java to teach Latino students how to code their math formulas/equations which they could use in exams if the program was completed. I mostly use git to track my progress and keep files organized.</p>

<p>Currently, I am sharpening my skills with JavaScript, AngularJS, Python, HTML5, and CSS3. I am looking for a position where I can progress and challenge my skills.</p>
